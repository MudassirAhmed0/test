where to start
From Ethan to Everyone 04:17 AM
May i have the control for a bit?
So on this page i would like 2 small changes:
From Me to Everyone 04:17 AM
okay, what are they
From Ethan to Everyone 04:20 AM
can you please switch to the tab with the offer?
right now you have to press the "add" button but it's bad for user experience
it would be better to just press the submit button
just have to press submit
and the values are save
From Me to Everyone 04:20 AM
okay you wanted to remove the add button completly
From Ethan to Everyone 04:23 AM
when you edit a recipe:
yes
you can see the value here
when you edit the receipe the value should remain in the popup
and there is the cook now page
and the behaviour is described here
From Me to Everyone 04:23 AM
okay
From Ethan to Everyone 04:24 AM
please take a look and let me know if you have any questions
From Me to Everyone 04:24 AM
okay.
From Ethan to Everyone 04:24 AM
i have stopped the control, thanks
From Me to Everyone 04:27 AM
Once started, I want a list of required ingredients to appear.
you want this to be appear in popup
right?
From Ethan to Everyone 04:27 AM
well, they are already displayed on each recipe
so this is already done
From Me to Everyone 04:28 AM
- As I click on an ingredient, it should be substracted from the available quantity in stock, and added to the "cooker".
can you explain this little more
From Ethan to Everyone 04:29 AM
you have the stock here
From Me to Everyone 04:29 AM
but where we click so it reduce?
From Ethan to Everyone 04:29 AM
if you use to cook something, lets say, 10 carrots
there should be only 5
From Me to Everyone 04:30 AM
okay, you mean  if we cook any recipe so the ingrediets used in it should be subtracted
From Ethan to Everyone 04:30 AM
when you press "cook" should substract 5 carrots and 3624 flower
yes
From Me to Everyone 04:31 AM
okay
Once all required ingredients were added a button should appear "Eat"
From Ethan to Everyone 04:31 AM
so there should be a timer for each recipe
From Me to Everyone 04:31 AM
you mean when we start cooking after the cooking process there should be eat button
From Ethan to Everyone 04:32 AM
yes, if it takes 10 min to cook something (timer starts) after 9 min the eat button should appear
right now i think the buttons are becoming disabled
From Me to Everyone 04:32 AM
the "kitchen" should be emptied
where is kitchen now?
From Ethan to Everyone 04:33 AM
also there should be a loading bar for each recipe
after you press "eat" the recipe should dissapear from this page
From Me to Everyone 04:33 AM
so wwhen I start tester
and once I eat it so it should remove from here ?
From Ethan to Everyone 04:34 AM
yep
the steps should be like this:
From Me to Everyone 04:34 AM
from recipes as well?
From Ethan to Everyone 04:36 AM
1. press cook Tester
2. a loading bar appears on Tester and the status text on the bar "cooking"
3. (optional) the Cook button should be renamed "Stop", or just disabled
4. on 90% of the time (also seen on loading bar) Cook button should be replaced by "Eat" button
5. when you click on "Eat" the recipe should dissapear
6. the burned dish part
From Me to Everyone 04:37 AM
okay, well thank you for explaining everything clearly
From Ethan to Everyone 04:37 AM
thanks for the patience. May i draw something fast in paint?
to show u where i think the loading bar should fit
From Me to Everyone 04:38 AM
okay,
From Ethan to Everyone 04:40 AM
can you please press print screen and copy in paint? i think i cant do that remote
thanks
something like that
From Me to Everyone 04:40 AM
okay, I understood.
From Ethan to Everyone 04:41 AM
and, one more thing
i think the measure coudl dissapear from the "my stock page" and also from "recipes" page
From Me to Everyone 04:42 AM
only quantity?
From Ethan to Everyone 04:42 AM
yep
From Me to Everyone 04:42 AM
okay.
From Ethan to Everyone 04:43 AM
the problem here is that you can only pick a few ingredients, it would be nice to have a input box to be able to add new ingredients
like, add any ingredient that you may want
a input under the title with "add ingredient"
From Me to Everyone 04:44 AM
you want one action in popup to add new ingredient
From Ethan to Everyone 04:44 AM
and a X near each ingredient to be able to remove it
yep, a input where you can write the name of the ingredient and the quantity
From Me to Everyone 04:45 AM
I think there should one more action button besides buy item (manage items)
in which we can add and remove
From Ethan to Everyone 04:45 AM
as you consider that it's better
From Me to Everyone 04:45 AM
Okay.
From Ethan to Everyone 04:46 AM
removed if we close zoom
better make a copy :D
